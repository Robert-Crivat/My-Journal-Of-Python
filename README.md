# My Journal To Learn Python
 This is my journal with all of my exercise what i follow from udemy courses to learn python

 The initial section will be the essential of python, so i will start with the basic structure of the code, variables, string ecc;
 First implementation of code will be very basic only from terminal but i want to implement GUI and work in many category like web scraping, data analytics and maybe I will have the possibility to impletemente some function in Klipper (FW for 3d printing)

 THIS README WILL BE EVERY TIME IN UPDATE SO CHEACK IT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW PROJECTS I AM WORKING ON

 26 apr # FAST INFO UPDATE

 Smal and fast update, the code inside of first exercises will be very compressed in most part of code for "ottimize" time and code just for fun and because write more than necesary line for this first exercises is not foundamental, about the exercises before nr 15 are not present because is the basic of coding so i skipped, for example nr 22 is a md file because in this ep / ex of courses talk about basic math operation.
